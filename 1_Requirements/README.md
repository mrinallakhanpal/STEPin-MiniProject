### Introduction

Calculator Application(Console application without any graphics) is a project that allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial, modulus, power). However, the input has to be in the form "number1 number2 number3...soo on" as in advance the user will be asked to choose what operation he/she want to perform (i.e, addition,subtraction,power,etc) on the numbers. The input values can be from any integer to even a number with decimals.

### Features

1. The System is user friendly
2. The System is efficient and fast in response
3. The System can be customized according to needs

### Defining our System

Our System is an actual implementation of how a calculator works. We demonstrated its internal working, along with all necessary equipments that a general purpose user might find handy. This calculator may well fit into any other subsystems and can be useful in such circumstances. It allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial, modulus, power). However, the input has to be in the form "number1 number2 number3...soo on" as in advance the user will be asked to choose what operation he/she want to perform (i.e, addition,subtraction,power,etc) on the numbers. The input values can be from any integer to even a number with decimals.

### SWOT Analysis

1. Strength         : Simple Interface, Useful through Calculus, Programmable, Easy Memory Management, Screen is Interactive.

2. Weakness         : Sometimes Need an experienced user to operate, Limited operations for wide variety of applications in modern era.

3. Oppurtunities    : Automates the impact of computation and technology, Progresses the problem solving insights, Develops a ability to describe strategy retrospectively.

4. Threats          : Threats like Virus attack, code vulnerabilty, or cross platform.
